# bhuvan_probability
A PyPi package for Gaussian Distribution and Binomial Distribution

Summary of the package

checkout - [My Python package on PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/bhuvan-probability/1.1/)

### Mean - is average of a given set of data.

### Variance - is the sum of squares of differences between all numbers and means.

### Standard Deviation - is square root of variance. It is a measure of the extent to which data varies from the mean.

### Probability - is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring

# Files
Explanation of files in the package

Binomialdistribution.py - contains Binomial distribution class for calculating and 
    visualizing a Binomial distribution.
    
Gaussiandistribution.py - contains Gaussian distribution class for calculating and 
	visualizing a Gaussian distribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working:
- Import Gaussian, and Binomial from the package bhuvan_probability
- In Gaussian give input for mean and SD
- Then In Binomial give input for probability and No. of trails.
- This calculates mean and Standard deviation for Binomial Distribution.
